    Zoom serves organizations of all industries and sizes because our platform can flexibly scale to fit any user count and budget. But one of the coolest parts of our jobs is seeing just how much of an impact Zoom can have on small businesses.
</p>

<p>
    There are challenges that are unique to running a small business — executing multiple processes with just a few people and limited budget, and prioritizing the time and resources to make it all happen efficiently — that can be solved with the Zoom platform. Why? Because Zoom provides easy-to-use video communications that empower people to accomplish more.
</p>

<p>
    Communications should help every growing business achieve its goals, but also help meet its constantly evolving needs. Zoom’s simplicity and ease of use, not to mention its tiered pricing and usage plans, simplify how small-business teams manage their time, enhance productivity, and scale the company.
</p>

<p>
    Here are five reasons why small businesses select Zoom to help them do it all and grow their client base, their revenue, and their organization.
